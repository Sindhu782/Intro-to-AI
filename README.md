https://github.com/Sindhu782/Intro-to-AI/blob/main/tic%20tac%20toe.webp
# Introduction:
Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic two-player game where players alternate marking spaces on a 3x3 grid with their symbol (X or O). The first player to form a line of three of their symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins. This implementation expands on the classic game by introducing a tournament format where various AI agents compete against each other.

# Implemented Agents:
The project features four distinct agents, each employing a different strategy to play Tic Tac Toe effectively are 
Minimax Agent ,
Alpha-Beta Pruning Minimax Agent , 
Expectimax Agent and 
Q-Learning Agent .

# How to Run the Code:

Execute the multiagent_tictactoe.py file.
Enter the names of Agent 1 and Agent 2 as prompted in the console, ensuring they are different.
Specify the number of games to be played in the tournament.
Observe and compare how different agents perform against each other in multiple game scenarios.

# Instructions for Running the Tournament:
Select two different agents for the Tic Tac Toe game. Run the tournament multiple times to assess and compare the performance of various agents. Analyze the outcomes to identify which agent demonstrates superior gameplay.

# Specify the required version of Python:
python_version >= 3.6
